Browser16K — Turn any image to a 16K image (no install, single file)

Turn any image to a 16K image from your browser — easy to use. No installation, single file.

Browser16K is a tiny, single-file HTML+JavaScript tool that lets you upscale/convert images to 16K size entirely in your browser. Drag & drop or pick an image, press a button, and download the result. No servers, no installs — just open the file and go.

⚠️ Note: Upscaling to extremely large resolutions may be limited by your browser or device memory. Use reasonable source images on lower-memory devices.
